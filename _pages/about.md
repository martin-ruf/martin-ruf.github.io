I am a professor at the University of TÃ¼bingen. I am interested in how to shape a fair and efficient tax system for firms and individuals. My research has been published in top accounting and economics journals. I have taught courses on tax law, taxes and business strategy, financial accounting and empirical research methods.

[The Effect of Taxes on CEO Performance](https://www.rsit-uni-tuebingen.de/app/download/12247723897/RSIT-WP-07-22.pdf?t=1705575546)


In response to higher taxes on compensation,
CEOs are less likely to reach performance goals and spend more time working in boards
outside of their firm. At the same time, firm performance drops before eventually
recovering as investment projects with below average profitability are disregarded and
due to adjustments in CEO compensation.


Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
